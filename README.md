### Quantum-K-Means

1) Implemention of the Quantum K-Means Algorithm using Qiskit's batched circuit jobs as described in the research paper, Stephen DiAdamo *et.al* **Practical Quantum K-Means Clustering: Performance Analysis and Applications in Energy Grid Classification** for a real-world labelled lung X-ray images dataset.
2) Comparative study of the Classical K-Means Algorithm and the Quantum K-Means Algorithms revealed similar clusters/performance for both the dataset.
